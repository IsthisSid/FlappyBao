# FlappyBao
## A Fun and Flappy iOS Game.

### Description
This is a flappy app version that flaps a bao (a delicious yummy bun). You stay alive by not running into objects, and at the same time, save as many of your edible friends as you can. Try not to get hungry while playing.

#### Background
Hello fellow coder :wave:. This was my *FIRST* project. I had a two-week break before starting a full-time clinical pharmacist position, so I took that opportunity to learn how to code. I chose to learn mobile app development because I use my iPhone for *everything* (gaming, scheduling, work, research). In two weeks, I learned the basics and decided to make a game. I liked Flappy Bird, so I looked up how to make one. The result was my very own version, and I successfully launched it onto the App store in 2020! I couldn't believe they accepted it! However, the game is no longer active. I had to take it down in 2022 due to "design spam" - there were just too many Flappy Apps out there ðŸ˜…. This was truly an amazing experience, and it was what pushed me to continue my coding journey. Although my current profession is pharmacy, I find every chance to learn more with hopes to transition into software development.
